<h1>LISATracks</h1>

Package to make animations of gravitational wave strain as function of time, for sources in LISA. Currently under development.

Currently only stellar-mass binary inspirals are modelled using the a custom implementation of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00304">TaylorF2-Eccentric waveform</a>, in the future I plan to add massive binary black hole merger and extreme mass ratio inspiral signals. 

PSD contains time dependent confusion noise (using implementation from Balrog).

Light mode animation option also available:
