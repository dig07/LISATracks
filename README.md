<h1>LISATracks</h1>

Package to make animations of gravitational wave strain as function of time, for sources in LISA. Built on top of the amazing <a href="https://www.manim.community/">Manim</a> animation library. Currently under development.

Currently only stellar-mass binary inspirals are modelled using the a custom implementation of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00304">TaylorF2-Eccentric waveform</a>, in the future I plan to add massive binary black hole merger and extreme mass ratio inspiral signals. 

PSD contains time dependent confusion noise (using implementation from Balrog).

Light mode animation option also available:

The above dark and light mode animations can be made from the following <a href="https://github.com/dig07/LISATracks/blob/main/Examples/Multiple_sources_animation.ipynb">Notebook</a>.
